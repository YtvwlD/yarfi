yarfi
=====

Yet Another Replacement For Init - writtten in Python

---------------------------------

Yes, that's the short description.

The goal behind yarfi is simple: providing an easy to use init system.
This simplicity should be achieved by simplicity. ;-)
The code that powers yarfi is very short und fairly focused on doing what it needs to do. (It doesn't heat coffee.)

*Enjoy!*
